# hello-world
Initial Github test repository.
I'm trying to put together a pretty good set of future skills early in my career.  
I'm very interested in the stories numbers tell, especially if they're different from the story I hear from other people.  
Lord, I should have been an auditor.  
At least I still have my soul, I guess?
